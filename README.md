Driver_TM4C123GH6PMI:

The purpose of the repository is to develop Device Drivers for TM4C123GH6PMI microcontroller

The microcontroller is present in the Evaluation Kit EK-TM4C123GXL. The drivers are developed from scratch. From the scratch development includes
    1. Writing Make file
    2. Writing Linker Script
    3. Writing Startup file
    4. Configuring Visual Studio Code to abstract the development process(i.e. and attempt to use VSCode as an IDE for our project) 
    
Visual Studio Code Shortcuts:
    1.ctrl+shift+c = cleaning the build folder
    2.ctrl+shift+b = cleaning, compiling and linking the source code
    3.ctrl+shift+f = cleaning, compiling, linking and flashing the binary to the EK-TM4C123GXL board
For debugging please use Cortex-Debug v1.12.1 Visual Studio Code Extension
